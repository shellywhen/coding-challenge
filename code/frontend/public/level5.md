# Level 4 challenge: Kaggle competition: Dogs vs. Cats

The task of this challenge is simple to describe, **make a submission to Kaggle for the famous [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) competition!**

Here is a little bit extra requirements:

1. You **MUST** use Jupyter Notebook.

1. Not mandatory, but strongly recommend to use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

1. In your notebook, include the public score of your submission to kaggle.

1. If your classifier is not 100% accurate, provide an analysis on the incorrectly classified inputs.

# Bonus

Take a harder challenge on Kaggle, [Google Landmark Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-challenge). This dataset is huge, and it will take a long time to download, one of the participant is kind enough to provide an one-stop download of all the images in smaller size, see [this discussion thread](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-challenge/discussion/55997).

Besides training a high performance classifier, try to use visualization to understand which part of the image is the most salient to the classification decision (You may take a look into [CAM: Class Activation Mapping](http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/)).

Remarks:

1. If the data is no longer available at the time being, you may look for another Kaggle competition that interests you, build a model and try to visualize.

1. If you take this bonus part, the easy Dogs vs. Cats challenge can be skipped, but the above requirements are still applied.

1. A well done bonus part can outweigh everything else!
